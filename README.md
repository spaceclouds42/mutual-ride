# mutual-ride
open decentralized rideshare software

## goals
provide a community carpooling platform for the yDSA @ UCF community
- reducing cars parked on campus by providing a way to find rides to/from UCF (carpooling on regularly scheduled rides)
- providing transit capabilities to those without vehicles (spontaneous rideshare to/from anywhere)

This is done through connecting people in the community together. What this software will __not__ do:
- it will not provide payment services (splitting gas money is great, but riders and drivers can arrange that themselves)
- it will not track and store personal data
